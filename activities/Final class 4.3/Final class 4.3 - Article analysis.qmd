# Instructions

Please answer the following questions regarding [this sleep study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2209123120). You will need your VPN on to access the study online.

## Objective of the study

+ Review the study's two pre-registrations
  - Write down the study's key hypotheses
  - Why did the study authors create two preregistrations?
+ Summarize the larger issue that the article is trying to understand.

## Study protocol

+ Please describe how the data is collected, what the sample size is, the specific response variable definition, what predictor variables were measured, and a summary of the nonresponse.
+ What problems, if any, do you see with this study given the study protocol? 
+ Does the protocol provide a good test of the hypotheses? Why or why not?
+ Do you agree with how the variables are defined to match the study concepts? 

## Summary data

+ What does the summary data indicate about the hypotheses? 
+ How easy is it, in your opinion, to generalize the result of this sample to other situations and contexts?

## Multiple regression

+ Are the conditions for regression met?
+ What do the results of Tables 2 & 3 tell you? 
+ Interpret the $\beta$ coefficients - is the magnitude of the $\beta$'s large or small? What are the units?
+ Can you think of any lurking variables missing from this regression?

## Discussion and conclusion

+ Do you feel the discussion and conclusion did a good job summarizing the statistical results? 
+ How serious do you think the limitations of this study are?

## Additional questions

+ What are some areas that you felt the author(s) of the study were unclear on? 
+ What connections between the results and the argument were unclear? 
+ Write around 5 additional questions you still have after doing a careful analysis of the article.

## Additional steps

+ If you have extra time, download the dataset for the study and see if you can replicate the result
