## Introduction

## Question 1: Describing your data (10 points)

### 1a. Where is this data from?

For this dataset, describe the data according to the five Ws & *how* defined in the textbook Chapter 1.2. What are some possible problems with the *who* and *what* of the dataset?

The original dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/jasonshi10/art_auction_valuation).

- `Who`: paintings that have been auctioned
- `What`: price of paintings sold, other physical characteristics of the paintings
- `When`: scraped from a website in 2018, years sold vary
- `Where`: various art auction houses
- `Why`: to analyze the features of a painting that predict the price
- `How`: scraped by github user ahmedhosny and cleaned up by github user jasonshi10, data scraped from website artsalesindex

> Possible problems: 

It is not clear from the github documentation which cases were scraped, there could be some selection bias in both what was scraped (maybe only some types of cases were scraped) and in the selection of art houses the art website monitors. For the `what`, it also is not clear how some of the features of the paintings were calculated in the rows - presumably it was done by some type of machine learning algorithm.  

### 1b. What are the variable types?

For the following variables, please list the variable type as defined in the textbook Chapter 1.3:

- `artist`: either identifier or categorical
- `country`: categorical 
- `yearOfBirth`: either identifier, quantitative, or categorical
- `name`: identifier
- `year`: either identifier or quantitative
- `ageOfPaiting`: quantitative
- `price`: quantitative
- `material`: categorical
- `height`: quantitative
- `dominantColor`: categorical

## Question 2: Displaying and describing the data (15 points)

For the moment, we are going to focus on paintings by Chinese artists. You can create a subset of your data using the `filter()` verb as you learned in the DataCamp lab. 

### 2a. Filtering your data

Using the `filter()` verb as described in the DataCamp lab, make a subset of your data that only includes art from Chinese artists. Show the code you used to make the subset using the `#| echo: true` code block option.

```{r}
#| label: q2a
#| echo: true

artdata.chinese <- artdata %>% 
  filter(country=="Chinese")
```


### 2b. Investigating height

Using the Think-Show-Tell framework from the textbook (example on page 71), investigate the distribution of the height of the Chinese paintings

Note: for this question and all other Think sections in the homework, you do not need to report the W's of the data (you have already completed this in Q1)

> Think

1. I want to summarize the distribution of heights of Chinese paintings
2. The data are height measurements of paintings from China contained in the dataset. The units are inches.
3. Since we are reviewing the distribution of one quantitative variable, a histogram is the most appropriate display.

> Show

```{r}
#| label: fig-q2b
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Histogram of height of Chinese art"
#| fig-subcap: 
#|      - "Original"
#|      - "Transformed"

ggplot(artdata.chinese, aes(x=height)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="blue", color="black", bins=15) + 
  labs(x="Height in in.")

ggplot(artdata.chinese, aes(x=log(height))) +
  geom_histogram(fill="red", color="black", bins=15) +
  labs(x="Log height in in.")
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-q2ba
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Relevant statistics of variable: height"

height.fivenum <- fivenum(artdata.chinese$height)
height.sumdata <- append(height.fivenum, length(!is.na(artdata.chinese$height)), after=0)
height.sumdata <- append(height.sumdata, sd(artdata.chinese$height, na.rm=TRUE), after=1)
height.sumdata <- append(height.sumdata, mean(artdata.chinese$height, na.rm=TRUE), after=2)

names<-c("Count", "Std Dev", "Mean", "Min", "25%", "Median", "75%", "Max")

height.sumdata.table <- data.frame(names, height.sumdata)

kbl(height.sumdata.table, col.names = c("Statistic", "Value"), digits=2) %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-q2bb
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Possible outliers of the variable: height (inches > 130)"

artdata.chinese %>% 
  filter(height > 130) %>% 
  select(c(artist, name, year, height)) %>% 
  kbl(col.names = c("Artist", "Name", "Year", "Height")) %>% 
  kable_styling()
```


The data appears to be right skewed. There appears to be a handful of suspicious outliers, but, on investigation, the values for height of each of these works appear geniune and therefore is no strong reason to exclude them. 

> Tell

After log transforming the data, the outliers no longer appear to be so serious. For the untransformed data, the mean and median are relatively close, though the mean is a little higher, likely due to the skew. The data is unimodal, right skewed, with a mean of `r round(mean(artdata.chinese$height, na.rm=TRUE), 2)`. Based on the data, we can expect that the height of each Chinese artwork will vary from the mean by an average of about `r round(sd(artdata.chinese$height, na.rm=TRUE), 2)` (the standard deviation). 

In more meaningful terms, the average artwork size height is about the size of three sheets of paper stacked on top of each other, which seems about normal considering how art paintings are usually produced. There is some variation, the standard deviation indicates that the size may vary by up to two sheets of paper worth of height, on average. The IQR is even larger, indicating a wide range of heights in the data. The outliers are more modern pieces of art that may be some type of more experimental art.

### 2c. Investigating width

Using the Think-Show-Tell framework from the textbook, investigate the distribution of the width of the Chinese paintings

> Think 

1. I want to summarize the distribution of the width of Chinese paintings
2. The data are width measurements of paintings from China contained in the dataset. The units are inches.
3. Since we are reviewing the distribution of one quantitative variable, a histogram is the most appropriate display.

> Show 

```{r}
#| label: fig-q2c
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Histogram of height of Chinese art"
#| fig-subcap: 
#|      - "Original"
#|      - "Transformed"

ggplot(artdata.chinese, aes(x=width)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="blue", color="black", bins=15) + 
  labs(x="Width in in")

ggplot(artdata.chinese, aes(x=log(width))) +
  geom_histogram(fill="red", color="black", bins=15) +
  labs(x="Log width in in")
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-q2ca
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Relevant statistics of variable: width"

width.fivenum <- fivenum(artdata.chinese$width)
width.sumdata <- append(width.fivenum, length(!is.na(artdata.chinese$width)), after=0)
width.sumdata <- append(width.sumdata, sd(artdata.chinese$width, na.rm=TRUE), after=1)
width.sumdata <- append(width.sumdata, mean(artdata.chinese$width, na.rm=TRUE), after=2)

names<-c("Count", "Std Dev", "Mean", "Min", "25%", "Median", "75%", "Max")

width.sumdata.table <- data.frame(names, width.sumdata)

kbl(width.sumdata.table, col.names = c("Statistic", "Value"), digits=2) %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-q2cb
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Possible outliers of the variable: width (inches > 200)"

artdata.chinese %>% 
  filter(width > 200) %>% 
  select(c(artist, name, year, width)) %>% 
  kbl(col.names = c("Artist", "Name", "Year", "Width")) %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

The data for width is also very right skewed with a handful of very distant outliers. One of the outliers was also an outlier in the height investigation (indicating a very large painting) and the other is a very long ink scroll. Both appear to be genuine measurements.

> Tell

A log transformation makes the distribution nearly perfectly symmetric, indicating that the data-generating process is probably logrithmic. In untransformed terms, the distribution is right skewed and unimodal, with a mean of `r round(mean(artdata.chinese$width, na.rm=TRUE), 2)`. Based on the data, we can expect that the width of each Chinese artwork will vary from the mean by an average of `r round(sd(artdata.chinese$width, na.rm=TRUE), 2)`.

In this case, the average width is a little smaller than the average height, at about 2.5 sheets of paper wide, on average. The standard deviation is actually nearly the same as the mean, in part due to the extreme outliers, but even the IQR is about 20 inches, indicating that there is significant variability in width, though less so compared to height. The large outlier indicates that some paintings may be primarily horizontally oriented and others primarily vertically oriented, which may account for the large amount of variation.

### 2d. Thinking about your results

Consider the results of 2b. and 2c. together. What can we understand about Chinese art from viewing the distribution of these two variables?

> Answers will vary here, good quality effort to interpret investigation of this question is required.

## Question 3: Relationships between categorical variables - American and Chinese artists and oil vs. ink. (15 points)

### 3a. Recoding your data

Using the `mutate()` verb and the `case_when()` verb combined with `grepl()`, create two new variables. The first is `material.type` and the second is `us.china`. The first variable should recode material to be either `Oil`, `Ink`, or `Other`, depending on whether the original values of `material` contained either the words `oil` or `ink`. The second variable should make a similar transformation to `country` where you recode the variable to be either `American`, `Chinese`, or `Other`. Show the code you used to make the new variables using the `#| echo:` true code block option.

Hint 1: you can see some examples of `case_when()` and `grepl()` [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_when.html)and [here](https://rud.is/b/2017/03/10/making-a-case-for-case_when/) .

Hint 2: make sure to use the `ignore.case=TRUE` option in `grepl()`

```{r}
#| label: q3a
#| echo: true
#| warning: false

artdata.uschina <- artdata %>% 
  mutate(material.s = case_when(grepl("oil", 
                                      material, 
                                      ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Oil",
                                grepl("ink", 
                                      material, 
                                      ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Ink",
                                TRUE ~ "Other"),
         country.s = case_when(country == "American" ~ "American",
                               country == "Chinese" ~ "Chinese",
                               TRUE ~ "Other"))
```


### 3b. Investigating the categorical relationship between `us.china` and `material.type`

Investigate the relationship between `us.china` and `material.type`

Hint 3: you can see an example of some ways to display this information [here](http://analyticswithr.com/contingencytables.html)

> Think 

1. I want to know if there is an association between country (US and China) and material type used in art produced by artists from these countries.
2. The variable `us.china` records if the artist was from the US or China and `material.type` specifies the specific material used in the artwork.
3. Since the variables are both categorical, we can use a contingency table to investigate their joint distribution.

Categorical variable check: the country of birth does not overlap (an artwork cannot be listed as from multiple countries) and the material type also does not overlap (only one material type is listed per painting). This categorical variable restriction is a limitation of the data; in reality, the artwork may actually have overlapping values.

> Show 

```{r}
#| label: tbl-q3b
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Contingency table of origin vs. material"
#| tbl-subcap: 
#|    - "Count totals"
#|    - "Percent totals by column"

artdata.uschina.table <- artdata.uschina %>% 
  mutate(`Material` = material.s,
         `Country` = country.s)

artdata.uschina.table %>% 
  tabyl(`Material`, `Country`) %>%
  adorn_totals(c("row", "col")) %>% 
  adorn_title("combined") %>%
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling()

artdata.uschina.table %>% 
  tabyl(`Material`, `Country`) %>%
  adorn_totals(c("row", "col")) %>%
  adorn_percentages("col") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(rounding = "half up", digits = 0) %>%
  adorn_title("combined") %>%
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

There are many more American artworks in the database than the Chinese, however, on a percent basis, most of the Chinese art is ink (67%) while American art is about equally split between ink (17%) and oil (19%), with the remainder of the art being of other types.

> Tell

Chinese artwork sold on the international art auction market is primarily ink, with only a small percentage sold in other category. By contrast, American art is primarily other categories, with equal amounts sold of ink and oil paintings. Chinese art sold is heavily ink-based whereas American art appears to be of diverse types.

### 3c.Thinking about your results

Think carefully about why you have observed this result and provide some additional information about what this investigation means for understanding this dataset and art in general.

> Answers will vary here, good quality effort to interpret investigation of this question is required.

## Question 4: Comparing groups (15 points)

### 4a. Recoding your data

Similar to the previous question, create a new variable called `famous.countries` that recodes country to be either `American`, `French`, `Italian` and `Spanish`. Mark art from all other countries as `NA` (the code that stands for missing or not available in R). Additionally, create a new variable called `area` that is a calculation of the area of the art (height times width). Show the code you used to make the new variables using the `#| echo:` true code block option. 

```{r}
#| label: q4a
#| echo: true

artdata.famous.c <- artdata %>% 
  mutate(country.f = case_when(country=="American" ~ "American",
                               country=="French" ~ "French",
                               country=="Italian" ~ "Italian",
                               country=="Spanish" ~ "Spanish",
                               TRUE ~ NA)) %>% 
  mutate(area = height*width) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(country.f))
```


### 4b. Compare the groups of countries on the variable `price`

> Think 

1. I want to know if there is variation in the variable price according to country of artist's origin.
2. The dataset contains the auction price of each artwork in dollars.
3. The variable price is continuous while the artist's country of origin is categorical. Therefore, side by side boxplots are appropriate to examine this question.

> Show 

```{r}
#| label: q4b
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Comparing distribution of price across select countries"
#| fig-subcap: 
#|     - "Original"
#|     - "Transformed"

ggplot(artdata.famous.c, aes(x=price, y=country.f)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill="blue", color="black") +
  labs(y="Country", x="Price in USD")

ggplot(artdata.famous.c, aes(x=log(price), y=country.f)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill="red", color="black") +
  labs(y="Country", x="Log of price in USD")
```

As can be seen in the first plot, the data is highly skewed and it is impossible to view the different distributions of price because of the data skew. Therefore, the data is reexpressed in log form in the second plot.

> Tell

In the log-transformed plot, the price differences become more clear. American artworks sells for the most, and Italian and French artwork sells for the least. In terms of variability, the Spanish art prices have the least variation while the other three countries appear to have roughly similar levels of variation among art prices. 

However, all countries have significant outliers on the high side. It seems that regardless of country, there are a few artworks that sell for a lot of money while most artwork sells for a much smaller sum of money.

### 4c. Compare the groups of countries on the variable `area`

> Think 

1. I want to know if there is variation in the variable area according to country of artist's origin.
2. The dataset contains the height and width of paintings in inches. Using this information we can calculate the area of the artwork.
3. The variable area is continuous while the artist's country of origin is categorical. Therefore, side by side boxplots are appropriate to examine this question.

> Show 

```{r}
#| label: q4c1
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

ggplot(artdata.famous.c, aes(x=area, y=country.f)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill="blue", color="black") +
  labs(y="Country", x="Area in sq in")
```

```{r}
#| label: q4c2
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Outiers for variable: area"

artdata.famous.c %>% 
  filter(area > 150000) %>% 
  select(c(artist, country, name, height, width, area)) %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```


```{r}
#| label: q4c3
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Comparing distribution of area across select countries"
#| fig-subcap: 
#|     - "Original"
#|     - "Transformed"

artdata.famous.c <- artdata.famous.c %>% 
  filter(area < 200000)

ggplot(artdata.famous.c, aes(x=area, y=country.f)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill="blue", color="black") +
  labs(y="Country", x="Area in sq in")

ggplot(artdata.famous.c, aes(x=log(area), y=country.f)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill="red", color="black") +
  labs(y="Country", x="Log of area in sq in")
```

In the first plot, there appears to be a very significant outlier. According to the outlier table, it is a work by Andy Warhol. After doing some online research, this appears to be a mistake value - the actual artwork is rougly normal artwork size. There are a few other high values of artwork that have a similar problem. Because these are mistake values, they are removed from this analysis. 

However, even after removing the mistake values, the data is still highly skewed. Therefore, the data is then log-transformed to view the differences in the distributions more clearly.

> Tell

In the log-transformed plot, the American art is clearly the largest, with French and Italian art being roughly the same sized, on average, while Spanish art has the smallest area. All four countries appear to have roughly similar levels of variance in the artwork size. There are some outliers in both directions, it may be worth investigating in further detail what the characteristics of the large and small art are (are they some sort of special types of art that should be treated separately or not.)

### 4d. Thinking about your results

Consider the results of 4b. and 4c. together. What can we learn about the differences in art between the countries? What do you think causes these differences or similarities? How would you confirm your guess as to the cause of the differences/similarities?

> Answers will vary here, good quality effort to interpret investigation of this question is required.

## Question 5: Considering deviations (10 points)

### 5a. Selecting your data

Pick three years of paintings to investigate whether the brightness of paintings has changed over time. You are free to pick any three years but you should pick years that correspond to different periods in art history. State the three years and justify your selection.

> Many possible options here, in this example I will use 1888, 1920, and 1950. Need some justification for the year choice.

### 5b. Finding the average

Calculate the average brightness for each of the three years. Show your code using the `#| echo:` true code block option. 

```{r}
#| label: q5b
#| echo: true
#| tbl-cap: "Average brightness by year"

artdata %>% 
  filter(year==1888 | year==1920 | year==1950) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(mean.brightness = mean(brightness, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(Year = as.character(year),
         Brightness = round(mean.brightness, 2)) %>% 
  select(Year, Brightness) %>% 
  kbl %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

### 5c. Normalizing the data

Find how many $z$ units each of the averages for the years are away from the overall mean of brightness and interpret your results. 

> Think 

1. I want to know how far away from the mean of brightness each of the years are in standardized units ($z$-scores)
2. I have the mean and standard deviation for brightness
3. Brightness is a quantitative variable but has no obvious units

> Show 

```{r}
#| label: q5c
#| tbl-cap: "Z score of the difference in brightness"
#| echo: false

# Calculate overall mean
mean.b <- c("Mean overall", mean(artdata$brightness, na.rm=TRUE), "")
sd.b <- c("SD overall", sd(artdata$brightness, na.rm=TRUE), "")

# Calculate z scores
z.table <- artdata %>% 
  filter(year==1888 | year==1920 | year==1950) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(brightness),
            z.score = ((mean(brightness) - 
                         as.numeric(mean.b[2]))) / 
              as.numeric(sd.b[2])) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.character(year),
         mean = as.character(round(mean, 2)),
         z.score = as.character(round(z.score, 2)))

# Convert overall mean and sd to rounded number
mean.b[2] <- as.character(round(as.numeric(mean.b[2]), 2))
sd.b[2] <- as.character(round(as.numeric(sd.b[2]), 2))

# Add overall mean and sd to table
z.table <- rbind(z.table, mean.b)
z.table <- rbind(z.table, sd.b)

z.table %>% 
  kbl(col.names=c("Year", "Mean", "Z Score")) %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

To construct the $z$-score, we subtract the mean from the observed value and divide it by the standard deviation, `r sd.b`.

> Tell

There is some difference in the years between the observed average brightness for the year and the standard deviation overall, but the difference, as we can see from the $z$-scores, is not large - at most a few tenths of a standard deviation. The years selected are all fairly close to the mean.

### 5d. Thinking about your results

What are some of the implications of your findings with regard to the motivation of this question? What are some of the limitations of this analysis? What other kind of analysis would you like to do to answer this question?

> Answers will vary here, good quality effort to interpret investigation of this question is required.

## Question 6: Your own investigation (15 points)

### 6a. Selecting your own question

Similar to the previous questions, think of your own question that you would like to ask of the data. Use the Think-Show-Tell procedure to conduct your investigation. Think deeply about what your result means. 

> Think

### 6b. In summary

Sum up everything that you have learned in this investigation. Do not simply repeat/rephrase your previous results but try to say something larger that synthesizes the results together to draw a more meaningful general conclusion.

> Need to think deeply about what information this dataset provides for full points.
